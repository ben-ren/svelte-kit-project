	<h1>About Me</h1>

	<p>
		I am Benjamin Rendell, 
		a professional software developer with 2+ years of professional development experience and a Bachelor of Information Technology - Games Design and Development. 
		This is my SvelteKit website portfoilio that I am using to display my technical skills in web development among other technical areas.
	</p>

	<p>
		Under the Home tab I show off some Svelte reactive features, whenever I think of new one's to add. 
		The Title uses the default image provided by Svelte as it is a good looking title image.
		The TextSwap feature is used to show off Svelte transitions and reactive dynamic inputs.
	</p>

	<p>
		Under the Technologies tab are links to different technical fields and skills that I wish to showcase. 
		Either as a topic of interest, a hobby or a career field.
